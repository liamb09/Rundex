# running_log

A simple running log to track mileage.

This currently is not published anywhere, but I am just coming back to it and plan to start polishing it up a bit and hopefully get it out sometime.

## For the future
(roughly in order of importance)
 - [ ] Finish mileage charts + goals
 - [ ] Improve UI
 - [ ] Add PR tracker
 - [ ] Parse distance from GPS data
 - [ ] Add run sharing
 - [ ] Add weather
 - [ ] Add starter survey
